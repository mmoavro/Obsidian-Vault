##### <mark>> The mission comes first</mark>

##### <mark>> Retreat is not an option</mark>

##### <mark>> A maniacal sense of urgency is our operating principle.</mark>

> *"... how do I accomplish my 10-year plan in 6 months? You will probably fail but you will be a lot further ahead of the person who simply accepted it was going to take 10 years"*
##### <mark>> Do not fear losing</mark>

It hurts the first 50 times but then you’ll be able to play with less emotion. You will take more risks
##### <mark> > The leader should be on the front lines</mark>

You should be a battlefield general

Never ask your troops to do something you wouldn’t do.

> *"If they see the general out on the battlefield, the troops are going to be motivated. Wherever Napoleon was, that's where his armies would do best."*

##### <mark>> Apply the algorithm constantly.</mark> 

1. **Question every requirement.**
2. **Delete any part of the process you can.**
3. **Simplify and optimize.** 
4. **Accelerate cycle time.**
5. **Automate**
##### <mark>> Question the Requirements()</mark>
 - Operate from first principles 
 - Have a relentless dedication to questioning every requirement.
 - Why are we doing this?
 - What does this mean > define it
 - How do you know that?
 - Why do I care?
- Dont spend time on shit that doesn't matter (details vs what actually moves things forward)
					
##### <mark>> Delete()</mark> 
- Delete, delete, delete, delete.
- You should go ultra-hardcore on deletion and simplification.
- Find the limit. You want to delete as much as possible and you can’t do that unless you find the limit.
- If you aren’t adding back at least 10% of the things you deleted, then you didn’t delete enough.
- Get rid of everything that fails step one
- One of the best allocation of resources > get 100% of resources back & eliminating switching costs
- The best part is no part
- Get rid of all the shit that doesn't matter					
##### <mark>> Optimize()</mark> 
Once you are left with what can clearly generate output from the system
- Optimize resources against the things that get the most bang for the buck					
- Give more resources to things that give more output and cut back on what's not working 					
					
##### <mark>> Accelerate Timelines()</mark>
**Move up Deadlines**	
> How long does it take in hs? 					
> What would it take? -It take 3hs > why cant you have it done in the next 3hs? Why not? > What do you have to do that is more important than this (tell me I am trying to understand) > You get to deciede what is the priority

**Increase Communication frequency**				
> When something is important and has to be done quickly, have meetings every 24 hours to run the algorithm and check on the previous days progress. You'll be shocked at how fast this speeds things up.
> 
> e.g: *"if you meet with someone daily, you'll get more out of him than if you meet weekly"*	

> People default > Do it faster, pull it forward					
> *"By pulling up the time-lines you can move 14x the speed (by meeting twice a day instead of 1/week)"*- Alex Hormozi				


##### <mark>> Automate()</mark>
Outsource the things you have to do on a consistent basis	

So you can focus on the novel things that build the future
##### ==> No work about work, just work.==
##### ==> Hire for attitude==
Skills can be taught. Attitude changes require a brain transplant.
Good attitude = A desire to work maniacally hard

##### <mark>> Always be fixing then main constraint</mark> 
 
- Alike industrialist of the 1800s /1900s (Henry Ford, Andrew Carnige, Thomas Watson)	
	
- Incredible devotion from the leader of the company > To fully, deeply understand what the company does and to be completely knowledgeable about every aspect of it > To be in the tranches and talking directly to the people that do the work > Deeply understanding the issues and being the lead problem solver on the organization
	
	> Every week > Identifies the biggest problem that the company is having that week 

	> And fixes it > Does that every week

- Focus on the fundamentals

- Attracts the biggest talent to come work

- Delegates almost anything > Not involved in most of the things that the company is doing

	> 100% involved in the thing that is the biggest problem right now > Until that thing is fixed > And then he doesn't have to be involved in it anymore 

	> Can go focus on the next thing that's the biggest problem for the company right now

	(westside barbell attack weaknesses style)

	> **Bottleneck** > There's always a bottleneck > whatever the bottleneck is, it's holding everything back > Your job number one is to remove that bottleneck > Get everything flowing again 
	
- Universalize that concept > Look at every company like a *conceptual assembly line* > In every given week there is A bottleneck > It is guarantee to be a main bottleneck > There's going to be one thing that's holding people back

	> One thing is guarantee to be the main bottleneck at any given time
	
	> Micromanage the solution to the current main bottleneck > Then move to the next (new) main bottleneck

- Everything else is running better by definition, not a priority

- Go down to the front line of the problem > to the people that are actually work (not through managers and chain of command) on what is the current bottleneck > technical proficiency/ability > sits with the actual worker that is having the problem and fixes it with them > <mark>Inspires loyalty</mark>
	> *"Go to the problem. Get on the plane. Fly to the source. Go to the exact location in the factory. Go to the problem and stay there until it's resolved."*

##### <mark>> Action loop</mark>
1. **Find the main constraint > Go 100% into it > Do nothing else until you fix it**
2. **Apply the Algorithm**
3. **Go to the trenches and stay until the problem is resolved**
4. **Then move to the new main bottleneck**					

- One thing a time > Only work in sequence > Always be fixing the main constraint and ignore everything else

 - All the other things to get done <mark>increase urgency</mark> > Then move to the new main bottleneck		
					
- You move faster chronologically than in parallel > Until the most important thing is not done you dont move to the second (in parallel you have two things not getting done at the same time)					
		
- You have to be able to say no to shit > Something may be important but it is not as important

- Discipline to see 10 things wrong an only fix one at a time
